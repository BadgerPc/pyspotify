Welcome to pyspotify's documentation!
*************************************

The goal of the **pyspotify** project is to create Python bindings for
*libspotify*, the `Spotify API library
<http://developer.spotify.com/en/libspotify/overview/>`_.

Currently, **pyspotify** works with *libspotify* version 7.

This is not the original version of *pyspotify*, as made by 
`Doug Winter <http://github.com/winjer>`_, but an updated version for use
with `Mopidy <http://www.mopidy.com>`_.
